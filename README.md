## 🎯 About This Course

This hands-on course teaches you how to build and deploy a real-time personalized recommender system for H&M fashion articles. You'll learn:

- A practical 4-stage recommender architecture
- Two-tower model implementation and training
- Scalable ML system design principles
- MLOps best practices
- Real-time model deployment
- LLM-enhanced recommendations
- Building an interactive web interface

## 👥 Target Audience

This course is ideal for:
- ML/AI engineers interested in building production-ready recommender systems
- Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Software Engineers wanting to understand the engineering behind recommenders

**Note:** This course focuses on engineering practices and end-to-end system implementation rather than theoretical model optimization or research.

## 💰 Cost Structure

All tools used throughout the course will stick to their free tier, except OpenAI's API, as follows:

- Lessons 1-4: Completely free
- Lesson 5 (Optional): ~$1-2 for OpenAI API usage when building LLM-enhanced recommenders

## 📚 Course format

This is a self-paced course consisting of 5 comprehensive lessons covering theory, system design, and practical implementation. All concepts are supported by open-source code in this repository.

## 🏗️ Project structure

At Decoding ML we teach how to build production ML systems, thus the course follows the structure of a real-world Python project:

```bash
.
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for each pipeline
├── recsys/             # Core recommender system package
│   ├── config.py       # Configuration and settings
│   ...
│   └── training/       # Training pipelines code
├── tools/              # Utility scripts
├── tests/              # Unit and integration tests
├── .env.example        # Example environment variables template
├── Makefile            # Build automation
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see our [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](https://github.com/decodingml/hands-on-personalized-recommender/blob/main/INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) guide.

**Recommendation:** While you can follow the installation guide directly, we strongly recommend reading the accompanying articles to gain a complete understanding of the recommender system.
